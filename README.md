# Behavior Analysis Project

This project explores the intersection of psychology and technology to analyze human behavior.  
It applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to understand how sleep patterns
influence mood and stress levels.

## Project Structure
- `docs/` — Psychology notes and conceptual background  
- `data/` — Raw and processed datasets used in the analysis  
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, and machine learning models  
- `src/` — Source code reserved for future extensions and applications  

## Dataset
The dataset includes information such as:
- Sleep duration  
- Sleep quality  
- Stress level  
- Physical activity and other lifestyle factors  

The cleaned dataset is stored under `data/processed/`.

## Methods Used
- Descriptive statistics  
- Correlation analysis  
- Data visualization  
- Linear Regression  
- Multivariate Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regression  

## Key Findings
- Sleep quality shows a strong negative relationship with stress level.  
- Better sleep quality is associated with lower stress.  
- Multivariate regression indicates sleep quality has a stronger influence on stress than sleep duration.  
- Decision Tree regression achieved high performance, though linear models were preferred for interpretability.  

## Goals
- Build foundational skills in AI/ML and psychology  
- Apply psychological concepts to real-world behavioral data  
- Develop research-oriented projects for higher studies and international applications  
- Establish a base for future work in behavior analysis and applied machine learning  

## Future Scope
This project can be extended by incorporating additional mood indicators,
longitudinal sleep data, or interactive visualizations for deeper behavioral insights.
