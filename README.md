# Behavior Analysis Project

This project explores the intersection of psychology and technology to analyze human behavior.  
It includes data analysis, machine learning models, and web-based interactive demos.  

## Project Structure
- `docs/` — Psychology notes and research summaries  
- `src/` — Source code for web pages and scripts  
- `data/` — Datasets used in experiments  
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for ML models and data analysis  

## Goals
- Build foundational skills in AI/ML and psychology  
- Create interactive projects combining tech and behaviour science  
- Prepare for further research and study abroad applications
- Initial focus: cognitive processes (attention and memory) as the basis for behaviour analysis.
