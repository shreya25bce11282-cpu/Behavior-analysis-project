# 🧠 Behaviour Analysis Project  
**A Psychology-Informed Data Analysis of Stress, Sleep, and Human Behaviour**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between **sleep patterns, stress levels, and human behavioural outcomes** using real-world lifestyle data.  
The aim is to combine **psychological theory** with **data analysis techniques** to understand how cognitive and emotional factors influence daily functioning.

Rather than focusing on prediction alone, this project emphasizes **behavioural interpretation**, laying the groundwork for future **human-centred design and HCI-focused interventions**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze how **sleep duration and sleep quality** relate to **stress levels**
- Interpret behavioural patterns using **psychological and cognitive principles**
- Build a psychology-first foundation for future **HCI and UX design projects**
- Practice research-oriented behavioural data analysis using Python

---

## 🧪 Methodology
1. **Data Selection**
   - Lifestyle and health dataset containing sleep, stress, and behavioural indicators

2. **Data Cleaning & Processing**
   - Removed irrelevant attributes
   - Renamed and standardized variables
   - Handled missing or inconsistent data

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Statistical summaries of behavioural variables
   - Visual analysis of relationships between sleep and stress
   - Identification of behavioural trends and correlations

4. **Psychological Interpretation**
   - Analysis grounded in:
     - Stress–response theory
     - Cognitive load concepts
     - Behavioural self-regulation
   - Focus on *why* behavioural patterns occur, not just *what* patterns exist

---

## 🧠 Psychological Concepts Applied
- Cognitive Load  
- Stress and Performance Relationship  
- Sleep and Emotional Regulation  
- Behavioural Variability  

These concepts provide a cognitive and emotional context for interpreting numerical findings.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Reduced sleep quality is associated with elevated stress levels
- Behavioural variability increases under higher stress conditions
- Findings suggest opportunities for **cognitive load–aware system and interface design**

*(Detailed results are documented in the notebooks and analysis files.)*

---

## 🔬 Project Significance
This project represents the **behavioural analysis phase** of a larger human-centred research pipeline:

- **Project 1:** Behavioural understanding through psychological data analysis *(this project)*
- **Project 2:** Cognitive load–aware interface design and user evaluation *(planned)*

Together, these projects aim to bridge **psychology, data science, and human–computer interaction**.

## Limitations

* Use of self reported data
* Stress used as a proxy for mood
* Cross sectional dataset (no causal inference)

These limitations are acknowledged explicitly to maintain research transparency.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* Cognitive psychology foundations
* Research style documentation
* Data cleaning and EDA
* Interpretable machine learning
* Theory driven analysis

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Design interfaces informed by behavioural insights
- Conduct controlled user studies focusing on cognitive load
- Extend analysis toward adaptive or personalized systems

---

## Author Intent

This project was built as part of a long term academic trajectory toward **Cognitive Science / HCI graduate study**, emphasizing clarity, theory, and research thinking over model complexity.
