# Research Arc: Sleep, Cognition, and Stress

This body of work investigates how **subjective cognitive experience mediates the relationship between physiological states and affective outcomes**. Across empirical analysis and theoretical inquiry, my projects focus on sleep, cognitive load, and stress as interlinked components of human cognition.

Rather than treating behavioral data as purely correlational, my work is guided by cognitive psychology frameworks that emphasize **mechanism, mediation, and interpretability**.

## Project 1: Behavioral Analysis of Sleep and Stress (Empirical)

**Objective:**  
To examine how sleep duration and sleep quality differentially predict stress levels, and to identify the cognitive mechanism underlying this relationship.

**Approach:**  
Using a publicly available sleep and lifestyle dataset, I conducted:
- Data inspection and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Univariate and multivariate linear regression
- Mediation analysis using interpretable statistical models

**Key Findings:**  
- Sleep quality shows a strong negative association with stress.
- Sleep duration shows a weak association with stress once sleep quality is controlled.
- Mediation analysis indicates that **sleep quality mediates the effect of sleep duration on stress**, rather than sleep duration exerting a direct influence.

**Cognitive Interpretation:**  
These results suggest that stress is not directly reduced by longer sleep alone, but by the **subjective cognitive restoration** associated with good-quality sleep. This aligns with theories of working memory efficiency, reduced extraneous cognitive load, and improved emotional regulation.

## Project 2: Cognitive Load and Stress (Theoretical)

**Objective:**  
To explore how limitations in working memory and attentional resources contribute to perceived stress.

**Focus Areas:**  
- Cognitive load theory
- Working memory capacity
- Attentional control and mental fatigue
- Subjective experience of overload

**Theoretical Insight:**  
When cognitive resources are depleted—whether due to poor sleep, sustained mental effort, or inefficient task design—individuals experience increased stress not as a direct physiological signal, but as a **cognitive-affective appraisal of overload**.

This theoretical framework provides the explanatory basis for the mediation effects observed in Project 1.

## Project 3: Predicting Cognitive Fatigue from Digital Interaction Patterns (Computational)

**Objective:**  
To model cognitive fatigue using passive digital interaction data, moving beyond self-reported psychological measures.

**Approach:**  
This project analyzes interaction-level behavioral signals such as:
- Interaction frequency
- Temporal patterns
- Sustained engagement indicators

Machine learning models are used to predict cognitive fatigue, treating it as an emergent cognitive state inferred from behavior rather than explicitly reported.

**Cognitive Science Contribution:**  
This project operationalizes cognitive fatigue as a latent cognitive variable reflected in interaction patterns, aligning with theories of:
- Attentional depletion
- Sustained cognitive effort
- Mental fatigue accumulation

Unlike Project 1, which relies on self report measures, this work emphasizes **behavioral inference of internal cognitive states**, a key goal of computational cognitive science.

## Unifying Research Question

How do internal cognitive states such as fatigue, load, and subjective restoration emerge from and become measurable through observable behavior and experience?

Across projects:
- Project 1 examines subjective experience as a mediator between physiology and stress
- Project 2 provides the theoretical basis for cognitive load and resource limitation
- Project 3 models latent cognitive states directly from behavioral interaction data

## Trajectory Toward Cognitive Science and HCI

Together, these projects reflect a progression from:
- Psychological theory
- To behavioral data analysis
- To computational modeling of cognition

This trajectory supports future work in:
- Human–computer interaction
- Cognitive ergonomics
- Passive sensing of cognitive states
- Human centered AI systems sensitive to cognitive limitations

My long term goal is to pursue graduate study in Cognitive Science / HCI, integrating psychology, data science, and computational modeling to design cognitively efficient systems.
