# Dataset Description: Sleep vs Mood

## Dataset Overview
This project uses the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset, which contains information related to individuals’ sleep patterns, stress levels, and lifestyle factors.

## Key Variables Used
- Sleep Duration (hours): Number of hours slept per day
- Quality of Sleep (1–10): Subjective rating of sleep quality
- Stress Level (1–10): Subjective measure of stress, used as an indicator of mood

## Why Stress is Used as Mood Indicator
Stress level is closely linked to emotional regulation and mood states in psychological research. Higher stress levels often correspond to negative mood patterns, making it a suitable proxy for mood analysis in this project.

## Purpose of Dataset
The dataset is used to analyze how sleep duration and sleep quality influence mood (stress levels) using statistical analysis and a simple machine learning model.
