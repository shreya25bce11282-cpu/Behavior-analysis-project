# Final Conclusion: Sleep and Mood Analysis

This project explored the relationship between sleep and mood, with stress level
used as a measurable indicator of mood. Using a combination of exploratory data
analysis, correlation analysis, and machine learning models, clear patterns were
observed between sleep-related variables and stress.

Exploratory analysis showed that individuals with better sleep quality and longer
sleep duration generally reported lower stress levels. Correlation analysis
confirmed a strong negative relationship between sleep quality and stress level,
indicating that improved sleep quality is associated with reduced stress.

Linear regression was used to model this relationship due to its simplicity and
interpretability. The model achieved a strong R² score, showing that sleep quality
alone explains a large portion of the variation in stress levels. A multivariate
regression including both sleep quality and sleep duration further improved model
performance, highlighting that sleep quality plays a more dominant role, while
sleep duration contributes to a smaller extent.

A decision tree regression model achieved even higher predictive performance,
suggesting the presence of non-linear relationships in the data. However, due to
the risk of overfitting on smaller datasets, linear regression was preferred for
interpretation and explanation.

Overall, the findings suggest that sleep quality is a strong predictor of mood
(stress level), reinforcing the psychological understanding that poor sleep
negatively affects emotional regulation and well-being.
