## What is Working Memory?
Working memory is a mental workspace that temporarily holds and manipulates information, allowing the brain to decide what should be stored in long-term memory. It acts as a bridge between incoming sensory information and long term storage, but it can retain information only for a short duration.

## Why Working Memory is Limited
Working memory is limited because the brain can actively process only about four chunks of information at a time. When we attempt to memorize information without understanding or divide attention across multiple tasks, working memory becomes overloaded. This overload occurs because information often enters working memory as isolated chunks, which require significant cognitive effort to integrate and meaningfully organize before they can be encoded into long term memory.

## What is Chunking?
Chunking refers to the process of organizing individual pieces of information into meaningful units, allowing them to be processed more efficiently within working memory. Since working memory operates on chunks rather than raw data, chunking reduces cognitive load.

For example, the hyphens in a phone number help group ten digits into two or three chunks instead of ten separate units. Similarly, while studying, grouping related concepts under a single idea reduces cognitive effort and improves recall.

## How Sleep Affects Memory
Sleep plays a critical role in memory consolidation. During sleep, information that was temporarily held in working memory is stabilized through neural reactivation and strengthened synaptic connections, enabling its transfer into long term memory. Poor sleep disrupts this consolidation process, causing information to decay or remain poorly integrated.

## Connection to My Project
Stress is closely linked to impaired cognitive functioning. Memory and attention depend on neural recovery, synaptic resetting, and metabolic restoration processes that occur primarily during high quality sleep. When sleep quality is poor, prefrontal cortex regulation weakens, emotional control declines, attention becomes fragmented, and working memory overload increases. Subjectively, this cognitive dysfunction is experienced as stress.

Sleep duration alone does not necessarily predict stress levels. Duration reflects how long the eyes were closed, whereas sleep quality reflects whether the brain underwent effective recovery. This explains why sleep quality is a stronger predictor of stress than sleep duration in my project findings.

## One Question This Lesson Raised
How can technology be designed to reduce working memory overload rather than exacerbate it, especially under conditions of poor sleep or heightened stress?
