# Psychological Foundations for Behaviour Analysis

This document introduces core concepts from cognitive psychology that form the theoretical basis for this project.

## What is Cognitive Psychology?  
Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of the higher functions of the brain, including perception, memory, learning, and thinking.

## What is Attention?  
Attention is the process of focusing on one or a few objects, persons, or situations while tuning out other stimuli.  
- **Subjective factors affecting attention:** interest, motive, mindset, and attitude.  
- **External factors affecting attention:** intensity, size, repetition, and movement of stimuli.

## What is Memory?  
Memory involves transforming received data into a mental form, maintaining it over time, and being able to access stored information when needed.

## Example of Behaviour Linked to Attention/Memory  
The common statement “I studied for hours but remember nothing” is linked to memory and attention issues caused by:  
- Divided or shallow attention leading to weak memory  
- Overloading working memory  
- The cognitive system being unable to transform the information you are reading into a mental form for long term retention. 

## A Question I Find Personally Interesting  
*How does constant digital multitasking reshape attentional control and long-term memory formation in the brain?*


## Note:
Sleep plays a critical role in maintaining attention and memory processes. Disruption in these cognitive systems impairs emotional regulation, which manifests as mood disturbances such as irritability, low motivation, and heightened stress.

## Link to Mood and This Project

Attention and memory do not operate in isolation. Both are highly sensitive to physiological states, particularly sleep. When sleep quality is poor, attentional control weakens and memory processes become inefficient, leading to cognitive overload.

This cognitive strain impairs emotional regulation, increasing subjective experiences of stress, irritability, and low motivation. In this project, stress is therefore treated as a measurable behavioral manifestation of disrupted cognitive functioning rather than as a purely emotional variable.

By grounding stress in cognitive psychology mechanisms such as attention failure, working memory overload, and poor sleep-related recovery, this project connects psychological theory with observable behavioral data.
