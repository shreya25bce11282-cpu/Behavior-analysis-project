# Introduction to Psychology

## What is Cognitive Psychology?  
Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of the higher functions of the brain, including perception, memory, learning, and thinking.

## What is Attention?  
Attention is the process of focusing on one or a few objects, persons, or situations while tuning out other stimuli.  
- **Subjective factors affecting attention:** interest, motive, mindset, and attitude.  
- **External factors affecting attention:** intensity, size, repetition, and movement of stimuli.

## What is Memory?  
Memory involves transforming received data into a mental form, maintaining it over time, and being able to access stored information when needed.

## Example of Behaviour Linked to Attention/Memory  
The common statement “I studied for hours but remember nothing” is linked to memory and attention issues caused by:  
- Divided or shallow attention leading to weak memory  
- Overloading working memory  
- The cognitive system being unable to transform the information you are reading into a mental form for long term retention. 

## A Question I Find Personally Interesting  
*How does constant digital multitasking reshape attentional control and long-term memory formation in the brain?*

**Sleep plays a critical role in maintaining attention and memory processes. Disruption in these cognitive systems impairs emotional regulation, which manifests as mood disturbances such as irritability, low motivation, and heightened stress.
