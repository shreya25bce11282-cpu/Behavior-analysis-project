# Cognitive Load Theory and Stress

This document uses cognitive load theory to interpret why sleep quality predicts stress better than sleep duration.

## What is cognitive load 
Cognitive load refers to the total amount of mental effort being used by working memory at a given time. Since working memory has limited capacity, excessive cognitive load can impair attention, learning, and decision-making.

There are three types of cognitive load:

a)Intrinsic Load: The load imposed by the inherent complexity of the task itself.

b)Extraneous Load: The load caused by how information is presented or structured.

c)Germane Load: The productive load that contributes directly to learning and schema formation.

## Role of working memory limits
Working memory can hold only a limited number of information chunks simultaneously. When cognitive load exceeds this capacity, information processing becomes inefficient, leading to errors, reduced comprehension, and mental fatigue

## Effect of sleep quality on cognitive load
Sleep restores cognitive efficiency by allowing neural recovery and synaptic regulation. Good sleep enables working memory to function closer to its full capacity, improving attention control and information filtering. As a result, extraneous cognitive load is reduced, and mental effort can be allocated more effectively to task relevant processing.

## Connection to stress
Poor sleep reduces working memory efficiency and attention control, leading to cognitive overload. When the brain is unable to manage incoming information effectively, this overload is experienced subjectively as stress

## Why this explains project findings
The multivariate regression analysis showed:

Sleep Quality Coefficient ≈ -1.27

Sleep Duration Coefficient ≈ -0.10

When both variables are considered together, sleep quality emerges as the stronger predictor of stress. This aligns with cognitive load theory: sleep quality determines how efficiently the brain processes information, whereas sleep duration only reflects how long the body rested. Efficient cognitive processing reduces overload, thereby lowering stress levels
