# Operationalizing Mood in This Study

## What is Mood?
Mood refers to a relatively stable emotional state that influences how individuals think, feel, and behave over a period of time. Unlike emotions, which are short-lived and intense, mood tends to persist and affect daily functioning.

## Why Stress Level Represents Mood
In psychological research, stress is strongly associated with mood regulation. Persistent stress often leads to negative mood states such as irritability, low motivation, and emotional fatigue. Therefore, stress level can be used as a reliable indicator of overall mood in everyday contexts.

## Measurement Choice
This study uses self-reported stress level (rated on a scale of 1–10) as a proxy for mood. Self-report scales are commonly used in behavioral and cognitive psychology to measure subjective experiences that cannot be directly observed.

## Relevance to Sleep
Sleep duration and sleep quality directly affect emotional regulation and stress response. Poor or insufficient sleep is associated with heightened stress levels, making the relationship between sleep and mood suitable for quantitative analysis.

## Limitation
While stress is not a complete representation of mood, it captures an important emotional dimension relevant to daily functioning and mental well-being. This limitation is acknowledged in the interpretation of results.
